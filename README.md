# metamus
Short python script for changing metadata of mp3 files.

It requires the eyeD3 module to be installed on your computer.
You can do this with `pip install eyed3`.

The script will ask you to specify a directory in your `~/Music` folder.
It will then walk you through setting the title, artist, album and track number for every mp3 file it finds.

To use the script, just run it with `python3 <path>/metamus.py`.
